CEDERGRUND

Welcome!

This is Gustav Cedergrund's repository for APPM4600 - Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing. All work for this class will be turned in via this git repo.

The directory structure for this repository is based on two main folders - homework and labs - with the type of content included in each being, I hope, fairly self-evident. In each individual lab or homework, included is my delieverables along with any python scripts or figures created along the way.

Any specific questions about the repository can be asked by email to the author @ isce7851@colorado.edu.

Enjoy!
