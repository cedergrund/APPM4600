The convergence of Aitken's method is a lot faster than the normal fixed point iteration. Calling the rate of convergence method we find that 
the convergence is still linear; however, the order of convergence sequence for Aitken's method produces an asymptotic error constant that is 
much smaller than that for the fixed point iteration (~0.016 vs. ~0.127)
